1. run npm install to install all dependencies
2. Open the folder in terminal/VS and run "ng serve --open"
3. The project will probably run on port "localhost:4200" (or any other specified port)

4. I assumed the size of images array is always > 5
5. I assumed that if there is a problem with loading the images nothing will be displayed, and an error will pop
6. The view state icons are not identical to those in the assignment, I tried to look for them but I haven't find them.
I also tried to make a SVG from a screenshot but it got very blurred...
